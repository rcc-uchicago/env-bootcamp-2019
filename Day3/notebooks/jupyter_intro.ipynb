    "Each notebook you open from the server interface will have its own kernel that\n",
    "runs in the server. This means that any function or variable definitions or\n",
    "imports are local to the notebook, and will be available as long as the kernel\n",
    "is running. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will only be using the Python 3 kernel for this short course, but it should be noted that there are several other kernels avaialable for the jupyter notebook server, including `R`, `Julia`, `C`, and `Go` among many other languages. Most of these kernels are not available by default and require additional setup to be available from the jupyter notebook. The default kernel used for an open notebook is displayed in the upper right hand corner or the page. If the cirlce to right of the kernel is an open circle it indicates the kernel is ready and idle. If the circle is instead filled, it indicates the kernel is busy executing notebook cells. If there is a disruption to the kernel his will usually be displayed the left of the kernel in the menu bar. \n",

    "**Please Note:** Since we are running from a docker image on a cloud resource, our session is ephemeral and saved changes will be lost if we close the browser. Therefore if you wish to save your changes before closing the browser you will need to additionally download the notebook to your local computer. You can do so by navigating to\n",
    "the folder tab on the right hand side of the jupyterlab environment and right clicking (on mac ctrl+mouse click) the ipynb file of interest and choose Download from the pop up menu. "
